<p>Students taking high school photography qualifications such as&nbsp;<em>A Level Photography</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>NCEA Level 3 Photography</em>&nbsp;often search the internet looking for tips, ideas and inspiration. This article contains over 100 creative techniques and mixed media approaches that Fine Art / Photography students may wish to use within their work. It showcases student and artist examples along with brief descriptions of the techniques that have been used. Approaches relate specifically to mixed media photography techniques, technical / trick photography ideas and interesting, fun or unique compositional strategies.</p>

<p>Note: The creative photography ideas listed in this article should not be explored haphazardly within a photography course, but rather selected purposefully, if appropriate for your topic or theme. These approaches may or may not be relevant for your own photography project and should be chosen only in conjunction with advice from your teacher. The techniques listed here are created using a range of different cameras and devices, such as a digital SLR/DSLR camera, traditional camera, pinhole camera and/or camera phone.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.studentartguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/water-photography-ideas.jpg" alt="Water photography ideas - Matthew Brandt"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Brandt has created unexpected and dramatic running of coloured ink by submerging printed photographs in water. After photographing lakes or reservoirs from around the United States, Brandt collects samples of water and brings them back to his studio. He then soaks the c-prints in water from the location that the image represents. Over time, the surface begins to degrade, creating images that are relics of this process. This is a great example of how creative photography techniques can (and should) be driven by the subject or theme that is explored.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Sew or embroider photos</strong>, as in the stitched vintage photography of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/maurizio_anzeri.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maurizio Anzeri</a>:&nbsp;</p>

The brightly embroidered patterns and delicately stitched veils cross the faces with sharp lines and dramatic glimmering forms. Note: Although Anzeri sews directly into found vintage photographs (often from flea markets and car boot sales) it is usually recommended that most high school students use their own photographs for this purpose.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Wrap torn plastic or other materials around the edge of your camera to create hazy edges</strong>, as in the photographs of&nbsp;Jesse David McGrady&nbsp;(via&nbsp;PetaPixel):&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.studentartguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/plastic-bag-photography.jpg" alt="plastic bag photography technique"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This clever photography trick produces soft, hazy edges around with a photograph, helping to create a seductive, ethereal or other-worldly atmosphere. Jessy David McGrady achieves this effect using a plastic sandwich bag, with a hole torn in the side. He places the ring of plastic around his camera lens, secured in place with a rubber band, leaving rough, torn, slightly crunched edges visible through the viewfinder (but not obscuring the image completely). The intention is that the middle of the image remains well-focused and sharp, while the edges become misty. You can experiment with using marker pens to colour the plastic or increasing the number of layers of plastic.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Use a hand-held glass lens or prism, to create blurred, abstract forms</strong>, like this photograph by&nbsp;Sam Hurd:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.studentartguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/handheld-lens-photography.jpg" alt="handheld lens photography effect"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A convex lens or prism held in front of your camera lens can create stunning reflections, distortions and ‘bokeh’ (see below) within and around your image. The results are unexpected and unpredictable, often creating beautiful abstracted shapes and colours that are not easily replicable using Photoshop. A hand-held glass lens or prism enables you to quickly add variety to an image, bending and directing light and colour from the scene itself. Sam Hurd has used this technique to create a strong focal point: a magical environment with attention swiftly focused upon the two figures in the centre. This technique takes practise, but can generate some spectacular results.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Deliberately unfocus lights to create ‘bokeh’</strong>, as in this beautiful landscape by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/turntable00000/sets/72157633979374762/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Takashi Kitajima</a>:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.studentartguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bokeh-photography.jpg" alt="Bokeh photography by Takashi Kitajima"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Takashi Kitajima stands on high-rise buildings and photographs Tokyo city at night, capturing radiant semi-abstract urban landscapes. This composition contains a single focused area, surrounded by circular, glowing ‘bokeh’ – shimmering orbs that appear when a camera lens attempts to record unfocused points of light. Bokeh is created in different ways by different lenses – typically appearing unintentionally in the background of a scene. In this image, Kitajima has used a narrow depth of field (so the area in focus is very small). In addition to being an exciting part of outdoor night photography, bokeh can occur in dimly lit interiors, such as when photographing sequinned fabric, glitter sparkle or Christmas lights etc.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Photograph scenes through visible hand-held lenses</strong>, as in this A Level Photography work by&nbsp;Freya Dumasia:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.studentartguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/photography-handheld-lens.jpg" alt="handheld lens used in photography"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Identity photography ideas: these photographs were created by distorting and inverting crowd scenes through circular lenses. The frame of the lens becomes a dominant compositional element, containing blurred and abstracted figures that are reduced to smears of unidentifiable colour.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Fold a photograph and make a installation, still life or sculpture</strong>, as in this example by&nbsp;Joseph Parra:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.studentartguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/photography-sculpture.jpg" alt="Joseph Parra photography sculpture"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Joseph Parra has cut and folded three identical prints with meticulous precision, creating transfixing, distorted portraits. Entitled ‘Oneself’, this work references the ‘fractured, multiple, and twisted ways we often view ourselves’. Many students search endlessly for still life photography ideas: this is a reminder that sometimes the photograph itself can become the still life.</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Paint developer sporadically onto photo paper to expose only parts of the work</strong>, as in these portraits by&nbsp;Timothy Pakron:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Paint directly onto photographs</strong>, as in these works by&nbsp;Gerhard Richter:</p>

<p><strong>Combine paint and photographs digitally</strong>, like&nbsp;Fabienne Rivory‘s LaBokoff project:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.studentartguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fabienne-rivory-photography.jpg" alt="Fabienne Rivory photography"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This project by Fabienne Rivory explores interactions between imagination and reality. Selecting photographs that represent a memory, Fabienne digitally overlays a gouache or ink painting, introducing an intense vibrant colour to the work. Students might like to experiment with this idea by creating a photocopy of a work and applying ink or watercolours directly (watery mediums will not ‘adhere’ to an ordinary photography surface).</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Redraw part of a scene with paint</strong>, as in these works by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ummatiddle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aliza Razell</a>:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.studentartguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/eliza-razell-photography.jpg" alt="Aliza Razell photography"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Although similar to the above technique, this involves more than applying painterly colours or textures to a work. In the example on the left, part of a digital image has been erased and replaced with a hand painted image. Many high school photography students have superb painting and drawing skill. Adopting a technique such as this can be a great way to flaunt multiple strengths.</figcaption></figure>

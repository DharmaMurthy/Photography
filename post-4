<p>Wildlife photography is a challenging hobby to get into because it takes a lot of commitment. To excel in this field, you not only have to develop your camera-taking skills, but you also have to learn about the animals that you shoot.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever wondered how the photos in animal books and magazines were taken, then these twelve tips will help you understand how it’s all done. Once you become familiar with the basic techniques involved, you’ll realize that taking photos of wildlife can be a very rewarding experience.</p>

<h2><strong>01. Choose a good camera</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://academy.wedio.com/camera-equipment/">types of cameras</a>&nbsp;out there, but only a few are versatile enough for shooting wildlife outdoors. The best choices you have are<strong>&nbsp;SLRs</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>mirrorless cameras</strong>. The mid- and pro-level models are typically weather-sealed, and they can be set manually and can accept different lenses.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A regular camera constantly exposed to harsh elements will not last very long, so you need a camera that’s&nbsp;<strong>weather-sealed</strong>. Although the extra protection makes it more expensive, knowing that it can perform in different conditions is enough reason to invest in it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shooting outdoors can also be challenging even for the most advanced cameras out there, so you need a camera with&nbsp;<strong>manual mode</strong>. You're going to need full control when the situation becomes too complicated to use automatic features.</p>

<p>Meanwhile with&nbsp;<strong>interchangeable lenses,&nbsp;</strong>your camera will allow you to take photos of insects from a close distance to large animals from really far away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>02. Use the right lens</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most common lenses people use for wildlife photography are&nbsp;<strong>telephotos</strong>&nbsp;because they can be used to shoot from long distances. Some of them feature optical stabilization (OS) to minimize shaking due to the extreme magnification, but these models can also be quite expensive. Thankfully, there are also cheap plastic ones you can use while you're still learning. They may not have OS, but you can always keep them steady on a sturdy tripod and use a high shutter speed to minimize blur.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a starter lens, consider getting a&nbsp;<strong>telephoto zoom</strong>&nbsp;to allow more shooting flexibility. A few hundred dollars can get you an 18mm-300mm lens that you can use to take photos from up close to long distances. If you look hard enough, you can even find some that feature optical stabilization. If you want to get a telephoto with a fixed focal length (no zooming capabilities), look for one that's at least 100mm. The best models are from old film cameras because they not only feature quality glass but are also affordable and durable.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re thinking of shooting insects and other small animals, you’re going to need a&nbsp;<strong>macro lens</strong>&nbsp;to take photos of them up-close. A 100mm lens with a maximum aperture of at least f/2.8 should be enough for most of your macro needs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can also convert your regular lenses by attaching them to your camera backwards (reverse mounting) with an adaptor or with extension tubes. If none of those options are available, you can always use a telephoto zoom to shoot at near-macro dimensions by zooming into your subjects from a considerable distance (not the most efficient but it works).</p>

<h2><strong>03. Protect yourself and your gear from the elements</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before you go out, make sure that you have all the essential gear to keep you and your equipment safe from the elements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="http://paulearlephotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://static-cse.canva.com/blob/561966/HuntingwithaCamera8.jpg" alt="" title="HuntingwithaCamera8"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by Paul Earle</figcaption></figure>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, you need a hat to shield you from the harsh sun or the rain. A<strong>&nbsp;boonie hat</strong>&nbsp;is perfect because the round brim doesn’t just protect your face but your entire head. You can even get a hat with a mosquito net to keep you safe from little critters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, bring a&nbsp;<strong>raincoat</strong>&nbsp;that’s big enough to cover you, your backpack, and your camera. You can use it as a mini tent in case of torrential downpours.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you’re in a colder climate, wear a thick&nbsp;<strong>jacket</strong>&nbsp;to keep yourself warm. You can also buy&nbsp;<strong>winter gloves</strong>&nbsp;specifically made for photographers that expose your pointing finger when shooting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To keep your gear safe, buy a durable,&nbsp;<strong>waterproof camera backpack</strong>. Choose one that doesn’t have bright colors as this can be distracting to wildlife when you’re out shooting. A good model has different compartments for your lenses, cameras, batteries, memory cards, as well as extra space for clothes and a first aid kit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, bring a<strong>&nbsp;rain cover</strong>&nbsp;for your camera and lens. It doesn’t matter if the weather’s perfect. The cover will shield your equipment not only from the rain, but also from dirt, mud, and other particles you might encounter outdoors. For added security, you can wrap a shower cap around the camera body or cover it with a clear food-grade wrap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><strong>04. Use the right settings</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The settings you choose on your camera ultimately depends on the shooting conditions, but there are general guidelines you can follow to get the shots you want.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sr_morenoo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://static-cse.canva.com/blob/561988/HuntingwithaCamera13.jpg" alt="" title="HuntingwithaCamera13"/></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by Francisco Moreno</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first thing you need to adjust is the&nbsp;<strong>ISO</strong>. Typically, it’s best to use a low ISO (100, 200, etc.) to minimize the noise in your photos. For low light situations, however, you can choose a higher ISO as long as it doesn’t affect the image quality. It all depends on the camera you’re using, but ISO 800 is usually enough to let you shoot in poor lighting without noise becoming too obvious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, you need to set your&nbsp;<strong>shutter speed</strong>. If you’re shooting animals that move a lot, choose a fast shutter speed to avoid any motion blur. Using this setting also allows you to shoot quicker and avoid missing critical moments. For slow moving animals such as grazing deer, 1/1000 sec. should be enough. For fast-moving animals such as birds, however, you’ll need 1/2000 sec. or higher.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps the most challenging part in shooting wildlife is knowing the proper&nbsp;<strong>focus settings</strong>&nbsp;to use for different scenarios. When photographing animals in motion, the best option is continuous autofocus. It actively tracks moving objects, so they remain sharp while you’re shooting. However, certain obstacles like snowflakes, leaves, or even other animals can easily confuse the autofocus especially when there’s a great distance between you and your subject. To avoid this, switch to manual focus so that you can adjust the lens exactly where you want it.</p>
